# Friend-Finder

This app is designed to take user input and create a new instance of the Person class to be compared to a database. The database is not _persitent_ as it does not use a database. It is simply an array of randomized entries that are pushed to the array whenever the server is awaken. 

## Score comparison

All entries are compared basedon the difference between each score in their survey, and the answer on the compared entry's survey. 

Scores are also weighted based on a RBG color comparison taken in hex color format (eg #ffffff).
